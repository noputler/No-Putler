## Our Mission

We are collecting donations that will be transferred to the hero or family of the hero which gets rid of Putin once and for all.

We understand the realities of the dictatorship of Russia, the money you transfer may not be needed in the near future as it can take a very long time to remove a dictator that is as well established as Mr. Putler.
_Therefore, we are making a promise to transfer half of the available funds at the following crypto wallets to support the Ukrainian army and help refugees every single Saturday at 1pm PST._

Your donations will start helping the innocent victims of war, whilest the reward for removing Putin will keep growing.

Maintenance of the fund and any costs associated with its maintenance will be carried out on a voluntary basis. 

In the event of the end of the war with Ukraine for reasons other than the annihilation of Putin, the entire amount will be spent on helping the victims of the war.

We understand that reason for donating is probably unusual for you. In order to avoid misunderstandings with the law, taxation, and just for those who want to remain anonymous, we have decided to use cryptocurrency. For those who want to leave their name, we will create a separate page. Money transfer reports will be published publicly (we are working on page displaying donations coming soon).
